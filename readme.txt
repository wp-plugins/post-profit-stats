Do you pay authors for page views? Let our plugin calculate the amount per post view and give you totals by date.

== Description ==
The basic idea of this plugin is so you can see the total number of post views per user/author with detailed totals and grand totals. You can also sort by date.

Setting this up could not be easier. Just add the amount per view you are paying your authors or whomever. That’s it! Our system will calculate the total number of views your webpage has received and multiply that by the amount you entered.

= The FREE version does the following =
  1. Allows you to track up to 10 Authors
  2. ONLY allows you to set ONE amount of money for ALL Authors per view.
  3. If you are logged in and viewing your posts they will not be counted. Only if you are logged out. (Authors proof-reading their posts dont get counted)
  4. Change the Sales Figures & Total Sales colors.
  5. Author's can login to view their details stats.
  6. Views get counted even with caching plugins. That’s right it will work!
  7. The information is recorded to your database.

= The Pro Extension does the following =
  1. Allows you to track up to 50 Authors.
  2. Allows you to set an amount of money paid to EACH individual Author per view.
  3. If you are logged in and viewing your posts they will not be counted. Only if you are logged out.
  4. Change the Sales Figures & Total Sales colors.
  5. Author's can login to view their details stats!
  6. Views get counted even with caching plugins. That’s right it will work!
  7. The information is recorded to your database.
  8. When you purchase a subscription the [PRO Extension](http://www.slickremix.com/product/post-profit-stats-pro-extension/) will become available for download FREE on your "My Account" Page.

= Tests =
We've also done the following tests to make sure the view counts are as accurate as possible. Here are a few. Again even if you have a caching plugin installed this plugin will still track views, similar to google.

Made external link to post
Result: jetpack counted the same as our plugin

Clicked: from internal link on website || Result: jetpack counted the same as our plugin

Clicked: from external link on Facebook || Result: jetpack counted the same as our plugin

Clicked: from external mail link || Result: jetpack counted the same as our plugin

Clicked: while logged into wordpress || Result: jetpack counted and our plugin did not count || Note: This seems proper to us. Why would you want stats on your logged in Authors for view counts? Another advantage of our plugin.

Additional Note: Our plugin only multiplies the amount by page views, not by comment counts. We just added the comments count as a bonus to see the activity happening per post.

**DISClAIMER:** SlickRemix **DOES NOT** code for IE. If it works awesome, if not we highly suggest one of the following modern browsers: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/), [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) or [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/).
